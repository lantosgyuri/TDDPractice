/*

Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum.
However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive --
then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens.
Write a separate helper "public int fixTeen(int n)
{"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule.
In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition").
Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main noTeenSum().


noTeenSum(1, 2, 3) â†’ 6
noTeenSum(2, 13, 1) â†’ 3
noTeenSum(2, 1, 14) â†’ 3

            15 -> num
            16 -> num
            in 13..19 -> 0
            else -> num
